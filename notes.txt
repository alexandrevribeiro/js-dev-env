# Sharing Work-in-progress
Packages used to share your local application across the internet without publishing it:
    - localtunnel (Easiest setup Ultra-versatile)
    - ngrok (Easy setup Secure)
    - Surge (No firewall hole, Hosting persists, Only static files)
    - Now (No firewall hole, Hosting persists, Only static files)

- localtunnel:
    * Using it to share your app:
        1) run you app (node myapp.js)
        2) Run the command: 'lt --port {port} [--subdomain {sub-domain}]'. Examples:
            - lt --port 3000
            - lt --port 3000 --subdomain alexandreribeiro
    * Combining it with 'Browsersync' would be a great idea to test your local app in muiltiple devices
